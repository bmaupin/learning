 * The StoneMasonKarel subclass as it appears here does nothing.
 * When you finish writing it, it should solve the "repair the quad"
 * problem from Assignment 1.  In addition to editing the program,
 * you should be sure to edit this comment so that it no longer
 * indicates that the program does nothing.
